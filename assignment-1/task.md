## Assignment 1
Create a new branch called 'feature/solution-assignment-1' `git branch feature/solution-assignment-1` followed by `git checkout !$`

* In your pdtspa repo go to the Tab `Issues` and create an issue for the following tasks
* Create a simple `bash` script that prints on your name and your favourite fruit to command line
  * Little helper [my first bash script](http://www.linuxcommand.org/wss0010.php) & [running your script](http://askubuntu.com/questions/229589/how-to-make-a-file-e-g-a-sh-script-executable-so-it-can-be-ran-from-termina)
* Define an alias in your shell that always prints out your name or an insult - up to you
* Extend your bash script that return everything you send I uppercase letters [there is an api for that](http://shoutcloud.io/)

**Challenge**
* Create another script that gets you employee oauth2 access token (hint the greyhound repo already does this)

### Deadline
13.07.2016

### Rules of Engagement
1. Use as much as you can the commandline
2. Add code also to the repository
3. Not finding a solution is okay - in that case describe what you have done
4. Documentation of the solution should be done in the folder within you repo
5. Always do pull requests on your repository - no pushing to master and no force pushes
6. No code changes with a github issue
7. When you are stuck - don't worry thats normal

**CV top tip** - You can add the Issue number to you commit message to connect your issue to the code change. Just do this `git commit -m "#1 foobar"` and push. Like pure magic ;)
