**Install Homebrew on you laptop and install git**
I did this by going to the [homebrew page](http://brew.sh/) and entering the command line /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" in the command prompt. I don't really understand what homebrew does and what the benefits are though, it does _something_ better than Apple but I don't know what.

**Create an SSH key and add it to your github configuration** 
That was harder. First had to figure out what an SSH key is and does (still don't completely understand), went through [github tutorials](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).
> You read this [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) but its essentially a secure connection between two endpoints. You can look at it like a key to a house. That should suffice for now.

**Clone this repository git@github.com:cgmv/greyhound.git - (needs your ssh key)**
Right, so going to your cgmv account I could find the repo, and then have the option to download it, or get it running on the Desktop version which you've said I shouldn't use. But what's the difference between "cloning a repository" and "forking it to my account"?
> Cloning creates a local copy on your machine
> Forking creates a working copy in your github account
> The main difference is that when you want to make changes to somebody elses code you cannot just commit the changes to his/her repository. Instead you create a fork and do a pull request to their repository.

**Fork a random repo into your account**
Done, just searched for "repo" in repositories, found one about Kodi (I'm using that to watch movies at home) and now it shows up as one of my repos (the other being pdntspa)
> cool, just wanted you to do that once.

**Document how you achieved this using markdown and add all the findings to you hibhub repo.**

> For the future I would recommend you to also document the commands you used making it easier later to just go back and copy-paste the command out.
